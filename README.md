# Bridging-the-gap-in-e-commerce
It is the lastest business project that is been developed on the steem blockchain, its intent is to use the power of steemit to bridge the gap in e-commerce globally. Exorpro simply means "exhibiting original products on steem". The project is dedicated towards exploiting the business conceivables on the steem blockchain.
We have been looking for ways by which end-sellers and end-buyers of different commodities can execute risk-free trades electronically without having to meet each other and also eliminating the fears of losing their products and valuables. It has been a major concern for us , as we have been victims of failed transactions online which most of the time involves loss of capital, loss of resource and even the purchase of sub-standard products abruptly.

THE GOODNEWS:

Impulsively we stumbled into steemit, we have studied this platform for weeks and we are very optimistic that steemit is a vehicle that can carry any developmental project with effective contents that can affect our world positively and add value to the steem blockchain at large.
With that in mind we came up with 'EXORPRO'- this project is dedicated towards maximizing the unique nature of the steem blockchain whereas turning a fraction of it into a business hub.

OUR MISSION:

 At Exorpro we intend to build both physical and virtual structures that will aid in bridging the gap between end-producers and end-buyers of products through the power of steemit.
 We also intend to add value to the steem blockchain and steemit, by attracting thousands of entrepreneurs through our platform, physical meet ups/seminar and online traffic.
 On-boarding new member especially entrepreneurs into steemit, teaching them to maximize the platform under supervision and guidance from Exorpro for profitable trades.
 Provide a b2b platform entirely powered by steemit, that will be a home for verified buyers and sellers of different commodities in different categories fostering risk-free trades with the steem cryptocurrency.

PROJECTS:

Currently we are getting calls from entrepreneurs /end-sellers of various commodities especially in Agriculture over here in Nigeria. They want us to physically engage with them , educating them on how this project 'EXORPRO' and steemit can enhance their trade experience.
Therefore, for the next 2-weeks this shall be our engagement plan:

 Engage physically with entrepreneur around Nigeria , teaching them how to use 'exorpro' and 'steemit' for profitable trades.
 Follow-up our ongoing b2b website construction and give feedback to the steemit community as we progress
 We are also acquiring a physical hub for product exibition, that will also serve as a meetup venue for entrepreneurs on steemit.
